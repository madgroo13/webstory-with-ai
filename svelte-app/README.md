# svelte-app

This is a SvelteKit application.

## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

Deployment to GitHub Pages is handled automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow. Any push to the `main` branch will trigger a build and deploy the static site to the `gh-pages` branch.
